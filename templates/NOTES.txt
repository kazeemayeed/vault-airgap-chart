Thank you for installing Vault in an air-gapped mode!

To verify:
  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=vault-airgap

Vault UI should be accessible via:
  kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "vault-airgap.fullname" . }} 8200:8200

Ensure your cluster has pulled images from the internal registry.
